## Reason For This whole Documentation

I my name is Michael, moving straight to the reasons for this documentation without wasting much of your time are listed below;

````
1. clear insight on the tools(framework) to be used and
2. what issues we might face when we go with any of the framework #team12 project

## React Native
React Native:  Here are facts i have gather about React Native

* Officially released in 2015
* The architecture of this framework depends on the JS runtime environment, which is also recognized as the JS bridge.
* By Facebook
* Installation: you need Node package manager(NPM)  
* 88,647 Stars on Github as  (13th July 2020)


### Advantages of React Native

Here are some advantages for going with React Native 

* Easy Installation with node package manager NPM 
* Easy learning curve because you it is majorly based on Javascript and not entirely a new language like flutter(dart)
* It has high Native performance and Hot Reload	
* It has more stability than flutter (5+ years on the market)
* Mature, vast community;
* Code can be easily reused for both web app and desktop app development.
* Plenty of tutorials and libraries, which allow quick and easy development;

### Disadvantages of React Native 
* Lots of abandoned packages
* Apps are bigger than native ones


### Example of React Native apps 

* Instagram (iOS, Android)
* Facebook (iOS, Android)
* Fb Ads Manager (iOS, Android)
* Pinterest (iOS, Android)
* Skype (iOS, Android)
* Tesla (iOS, Android)
* Bloomberg (iOS, Android)
* Wix.com (iOS · Android)


## Flutter

Flutter: Here are some Facts i have gather about Flutter

* Initially released in 2017
* The Dart-based framework utilizes the Skia C++ engine
* By google 
* Installation: binary source required or flutter zip
* 95,850 Stars on Github as  (13th July 2020)


### Advantages of Flutter

Here are some advantages for going with React Native 

* More performance efficiency than React Native because  doesnt require such a bridge as Dart code is compiled into native code
* Easy Automation.
* Rapidly growing community, and popularity;
* Excellent documentation with strong support from the Flutter team (which makes it easy to start developing with Flutter);


### Disadvantages of Flutter

* Improving Flutter for Web, offering the potential for one codebase across mobile and web platforms
* Difficult to beat time-to-market length.
* Size of the developer community less compared to that of react native
* Libraries & support – impressive, but still not as rich as native development
* App’s size: Applications written in Flutter are much bigger than native ones.


### Example of Flutter apps 
* Xianyu app by Alibaba (App on App Store, App on Google Play) 
* Hamilton app (App on App Store, App on Google Play, Website)
* Google Ads app (App on App Store, App on Google Play)
* Reflectly (App on App Store, App on Google Play, Website)
* App for JD Finance – a leading digital technology company (App on App Store)
* Topline app by Abbey Road Studios (App on App Store, App on Google Play)

## Recommendations 

Better still, Flutter and React Native offer more than just speedy development, they can reduce project costs as well.

…and these are the key reasons you should consider either framework for your project. But which solution offers the fastest development time? Or fits your app idea best?

Well, that depends on the specifics of your project and the balance of your team’s skills.

Do your developers know Dart? If yes, then programming with Flutter will be a walk in the park.
Are your developers fluent in JavaScript? If yes, then React Native seems the logical choice.
Do you want to build your app’s GUI using native UI components? If yes, choose React Native.
Is brand-first design your priority? If yes, we suggest Flutter fits the bill.
